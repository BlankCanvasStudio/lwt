!! STILL NEED TO FIGURE OUT DATA LOADING



Takes some CLI argument OUTPUT_LOC
    - Stores it in of (i guess output file)
ofname = OUTPUT_LOC + Pa-CUMUL.py

confname = "svm-conf.results"

if CORE_NAME specified in the CLI, then "-" + <CORE_NAME> is added to the end of ofname and 
    confname

You can specify DO_NOT_EXTRACT
    - if equal to 1 then:
        1) skipext = 1
        2) trainext = EXTRACT_TRAIN_LOC
        3) testext  = EXTRACT_TEST_LOC

If you don't specify it then:
    1) trainext = ofname + '.train'
    2) testext = ofname + '.test'

    if GEN_OWN_LIST = 1 then:

!! Looks like gen_list was changed to get_list and not updated properly

= SVM_C_LOG and SVM_G_LOG
    - Unknown what these do but we need to know asap. If not tuned correctly, things can break



## TO RUN:
    $ python3 ./Pa-CUMUL.py options.txt
## Generates datafile:
    > output.test
    > output.train
    - These files are then fed into libsvm
