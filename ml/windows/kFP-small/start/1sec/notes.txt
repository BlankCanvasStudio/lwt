loaders.py seems to be what parses the data from the file

To overload you need to re-write get_pkt_list to read the file data. The issue is that
    there is directional data in this method so we need to do something about that
    - Trying to spoof this could be fun


To Run:
    $ python3 wrapper.py options.txt


!! Currently working on this. Need to get the loading process fixed. Something which isn't a 
!! Number is finding its way into total somehow. Need to fix this
