NOTE:
I realized that the previous websites were actually finger printing the outbound requests, not 
    the traffic into the client. This is definitely why there is much less clarity in the data 
    (unless the client has to query the server for more information). To fix this issue, I re-ran
    the simulations recording the traffic into the client and dubbed them `reverse`. The following
    simulations record the reverse direction and use the same settings as their counterpart above:

        - wget-multiple-reversed=35
        - amazon-add-to-cart-reverse=36
        - amazon-browse-front-reversed=37
        - astley-youtube-adblock-reversed=38
        - facebook-default-route-reversed=39
        - gdocs-basic-writing-reversed=40
        - gdocs-listen-to-writing-diff-reversed=41
        - gmail-basic-recieving-reversed=42
        - gmail-basic-sending-reversed=43
        - google-basic-search-reversed=44
        - gtranslate-basic-lorem-reversed=45
        - gtranslate-french-lorem-reversed=46
        - wget-wikipedia-reversed=47
        - twitch-basic-streamer-view-reversed=48



NOTE:
All of the following mixed programs are running in the 'reverse' direction for both programs. This
    means that all the data is flowing from the server to the client, in the same direction as the
    foreground iperf traffic.

mixed-gdoc-basic-writing-youtube-ads=49
