!! CAN DO DATA REPLACEMENT

Build flearner with:
    $ g++ flearner.cpp -o flearner
        - flearner.cpp is classifier file. fleaner is necessary output name
    $ g++ classifier.cpp -o flearner


The Wa-kNN file writes a series of files, one with file names of training set, one with testing
    set, one with weights (idk what that is yet). The it makes a log file, then it makes a log 
    file for the classifier. 

You set everything in options.txt

All options are saved to log file so you know what outputs are related

The files are in data_loc

The data is separated in files with the format

    <site-num>-<trial-num>.<data_type>

All these files are pointed to in the config files built in the beginning of Wa-kNN.py

The the feature extractor is called on these files
    $ This is the section of the program we need to overload

Then the c++ classifier is called on the data
    - This looks like it handles all the training and such


## TO RUN:
    $ ./Wa-kNN.py options.txt
