# Welcome to LWT

## File Structure

This project is split into 5 main folders:

1) analysis: Contains nice visualizations and other (non-machine learning) tools.

2) data: Contains all the data generated by each experiment, neatly stashed into its own folder.

3) init: Split into two sub-directories, which contain all the start-up scripts to build the necessary components.

    - loc: Contains files which install various software on the local machine.

    - xdc: Contains files which install on remote hosts using the syntax:

            ./x0-<name>, <username>@<remote host>

4) ml: Contains all the machine learning methods applied to the data.

5) nfra: Contains all the code infrastructure necessary to run the experiments. Currently split into sub-directories:

    - collection: Contains the custom dpdk & click code used to create the data-collecting router.

    - generation: Contains the different packet generation techniques this project analyzes (be it the pipe generation or interfering traffic).

## Configuration

In an attempt to make this package as simple as possible, nearly every important feature is specified in `./config-test.sh`. The configuration options should be clearly labeled in the file, but drop an issue if not!

## Functionality

> Note: All commands are meant to be run from the root of the project. Many scripts source `./config-test.sh`.

`./build-test.sh`: This file reads the configuration file and installs the click router, the pipe generator, the pipe receiver, the external host, and the external server. Each host's software is downloaded to their system, but THEY ARE NOT TURNED ON.

`./run-test.sh`: This file reads the config and runs a test. Must be run AFTER `./build-test.sh` if the testing env has not previously been set up or if any settings have changed.

- The test will generate a CSV, pcap data file, and a copy of the config. The pcap is the recorded data from the tapped server (specified in the config by `srvr_tap`). The CSV file is a record of the size and timestamp of each packet received by the click router set up before the pipe receiver (specified in the config by `click_collector`). The CSV saves data in the form `size:timestamp, size:timestamp` (size is an int, and the timestamp is a float).

`./analysis/csv-vis.py`: This file plots timestamps recorded by `click_collector` for each packet received. Helpful for intuition.

`./nfra/bind.sh`: This script binds the specified interface as a dpdk interface (used when building the click router in `build-test.sh`).

- Uses the syntax:

        ./nfra/bind.sh eth1

`./init/loc/dpdk.sh`: Installs dpdk on the current machine.

`./init/loc/fc.sh`: Installs fastclick with the custom data recorder element on the current machine. Doesn't install the router file, as that isn't necessary at compile time.

`./init/xdc/dpdk.sh`: Installs dpdk on the remote hosts specified.

- Uses the syntax:

        ./init/xdc/dpdk.sh remoteOne, remoteTwo

`./init/xdc/fc.sh`: Installs fastclick on the remote host specified with the same syntax as `./init/xdc/dpdk.sh`. This file is left on the host machine, in the home directory, during `./build-test.sh`. It can be used to recompile fastclick if one wants to make edits to the components currently installed.

- To recompile, navigate to ~ (the same location fastclick is installed) and run:

        ./fastclick.sh recomp
